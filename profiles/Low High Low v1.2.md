A fast shot with a high ratio for reduced TDS to minimize harsh notes. High extraction basket and light roast recommended. 
17g dose, 60g output (1:3.52) - if adjusting dose, change phase 2 weight exit condition to match (83% of final output)

Dialling In Recommendations:
Phase 2 flowrate recommendations - 5-8 g/s
Phase 2 pressure recommendations - 5-7 bar
